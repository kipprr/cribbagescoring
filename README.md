# Cribbage Scoring
A Python repo that explores how the card game Cribbage is scored

## Why can't you score 19 points with a Cribbage hand?

I asked my friend this question after she taught me how to play and told me that if you score 0 points, you can say 19 since everyone knows you can't score 19 points with a hand. I decided to have a little fun with coding and verify that there is no way to score 19 points. There are 12,994,800 possible hands in Cribbage (including the turned up card) and with the code in this repo I verified that there is no way to score 19 points with any of those hands (or 25,26,27 points).
